		<h2>Hearthstone is a great game with an unique competitive ladder.</h2>
		<div class="desc">
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Users join a queue where they are matched against other players.</h3>
				<p>Everyone has a rank starting at 20 and improving to 1. When you win you can improve you rank, when you lose games you can lose rank.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="point">
				<h3>The ladder chooses another player with the same rank to play against.</h3>
				<p>Unlike previous Blizzard ladders this doesn't use an estimate of your skill.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="point">
				<h3>This system works well.</h3>
				<p>Strong players win a lot and improve in rank, weak players don't advance. Players quickly advance to a rank where others of similar skill are. Most matches are competitive because of the similar strength of players.</p>

		<h2>The ladder resets every month</h2>

				<h3>Everyone becomes the same level.</h3>
				<span>After a reset everyone is the same rank and so they play each other randomly. The average difference in skill between players becomes very high.</span>

				<h3>The compact ladder makes games one sided.</h3>
				<span>The average difference in skill between players becomes very high. This isn't fun for anyone. Good players aren't challenged and bad players have no chance. Most games are one sided, not fun for either party.</span>

		<h2>The problem lasts longer than it should</h2>
		<div class="desc">
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Negative feedback loops are built into the system.</h3>
				<span>As the better players start to improve in rank they will play against the other good players. This slows their rate of rank improvement.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Moderately skilled players can't keep their improved rank.</h3>
				<span>Any mediocre player who improves in rank will play against the really good players, causing them to lose rank. This gain and loss could keep happening until the better players have ranked farther along.</span>

		<h2>What other options should Blizzard consider?</h2>
		<div class="desc">
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Don't reset the ladder so often.</h3>
				<span>The first week of every month will be full of terrible games. Until they get past the clutter, good players are wasting their time. During ths time new and weak players get stomped. The ladder system works well except during this initial period.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Use an MMR based match making system.</h3>
				<span>Other Blizzard games predict players skill based on their past results, using this "MMR" tool allows for better matchings.</span>

				<h3>This is my personal analysis and opinion.</h3>
        <p>I don't think the issues with the ladder are incredibly serious, but the the ladder is less than ideal. My goal with this site was to explore this interesting ladder issue I've run across.</p>

        <p>The simulation was written in Coffeescript, you can see the entire codebase <a href="https://github.com/Zack-Tillotson/HearthstoneLadderSim">here</a>.</p>
