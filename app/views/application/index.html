		<h2>Hearthstone is a great game with an unique competitive ladder.</h2>
		<div class="desc">
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Users join a queue where they are matched against other players.</h3>
				<p>Everyone has a rank starting at 20 and improving to 1. When you win you can improve you rank, when you lose games you can lose rank.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="point">
				<h3>The ladder chooses another player with the same rank to play against.</h3>
				<p>Unlike previous Blizzard ladders this doesn't use an estimate of your strength.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="point">
				<h3>This system works well.</h3>
				<p>Strong players win a lot and improve in rank, weak players don't advance. Players quickly advance to a rank where others of similar strength are. Most matches are competitive because of the similar strength of players.</p>

		<h2>The ladder resets every month</h2>
		<div class="desc">

				<h3>Everyone becomes the same level.</h3>
				<p>After a reset everyone is the same rank and so they play each other randomly. The average difference in strength between players becomes very high, especially for the strongest and weakest players.</p>

				<h3>The compact ladder makes games one sided.</h3>
				<p>The average difference in strength between players becomes very high. This isn't fun for anyone. Good players aren't challenged and bad players have no chance. Most games are one sided, not fun for either party.</p>

		<div class="desc">
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Negative feedback loops are built into the system.</h3>
				<p>As the better players start to improve in rank they will play against the other good players. This slows their rate of rank improvement.</p>

				<h3>Moderately skilled players can't keep their improved rank.</h3>
				<p>Any mediocre player who improves in rank will lose that rank quickly because they play against the good players. This back and frth keeps happening until the better players have ranked farther along.</p>

		<h2>What other options should Blizzard consider?</h2>
		<div class="desc">
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Don't reset the ladder so often.</h3>
				<p>The first week of every month will be full of terrible games. Until the ladder sorts itself, good players are wasting their time and weak players will just get stomped. The ladder system works well except during this initial period, so minimize how often it's in that state.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="point">
				<h3>Use an MMR based match making system.</h3>
				<p>Other Blizzard games predict players skill based on their past results when choosing opponents, using this "MMR" tool allows for better matchings.</p>

    <h2>About The Site</h2>
		<div class="desc">
			<div class="point">
				<h3>This is just one guy's analysis and opinion.</h3>
        <p>My goal with this site was to explore this interesting ladder issue. I don't think these issues are incredibly serious, but the the ladder is less than ideal so why not fix it. You can see more of my work at <a href="http://www.ZacheryTillotson.com">ZacheryTillotson.com</a>.</p>
      </div>

				<h3>Want more information on the simulation?</h3>
        <p>The page and simulation was written in Coffeescript within a RoR environment (the <a href="https://github.com/Zack-Tillotson/HearthstoneLadderSim">codebase</a>). Besides the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> libraries, I used <a href="hthe ttp://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/">Rickshaw</a> for the graphs and <a href="https://github.com/peachananr/onepage-scroll">Onepage Scroll</a> for the scroll effect.</p>
